# mast
data sets used in the R package vignette

`mast` estimates productivity of particles at point sources and their dispersion on the basis of counts observed at detectors.  Inference requires information on locations of sources and detectors, and covariates that could explain source strength.  It is motivated by a specific application, seed or pollen production, "masting", by plants.  Counts derive from known location and collection area, such as seed traps or particle collectors.  Data sets of this type are used to understand a range of processes related to seed dispersal, masting, environmental controls on reproduction, sex ratio, and allocation.
